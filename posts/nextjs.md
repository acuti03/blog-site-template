## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

## How to use the docs

The docs are organized into 3 sections:

- Getting Started: Step-by-step tutorials to help you create a new application and learn the core Next.js features.
- Guides: Tutorials on specific use cases, choose what's relevant to you.
- API Reference: Detailed technical reference for every feature.

Use the sidebar to navigate through the sections, or search (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) to quickly find a page.

## App Router and Pages Router

Next.js has two different routers:

- **App Router**: The newer router that supports new React features like Server Components.
- **Pages Router**: The original router, still supported and being improved.

At the top of the sidebar, you'll notice a dropdown menu that allows you to switch between the App Router and the Pages 
Router docs.

## Pre-requisite knowledge

Our documentation assumes some familiarity with web development. Before getting started, it'll help if you're comfortable with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React

If you're new to React or need a refresher, we recommend starting with our React Foundations course, and the Next.js Foundations course that has you building an application as you learn.

## Accessibility

For the best experience when using a screen reader, we recommend using Firefox and NVDA, or Safari and VoiceOver.
